1. Overview

It has five DSPs. One for each effect family and one for amplifier
emulation. DSPs are addressed from 5 to 9. I don't know why first five
addresses are omitted and if this means anything.  DSPs with their
functionality are as follows:

    0x05 - amplifier emulation
    0x06 - stompbox effects
    0x07 - modulation effects
    0x08 - delay effects
    0x09 - reverb effects

    I also have found packets with device address 0x0a but don't know what this is.

2. Connecting

All the transmission between program and amplifier is using USB
interrupt transfer. Endpoint to which you want to send data is 0x01
and USB interface which you want to claim is 0x00. If you want to
receive data from amplifier use endpoint 0x81.

Each packet carries 64 bytes of data.

When connecting you should send two packets to the amp and get
response for each of them. First should have value "0xc3" set on the
first position (counting from zero) and second values "0x1a" and
"0x03" on zeroth and first position.

After that a packet asking for amp's settings is send. The packet is
of form "0xff" on zeroth and "0xc1" on first position. Amplifier
responds to that sending:

    names of all presets in the form:

        packet with name in a form: values "0x1c 0x01 0x04" as first
        three bytes, then slot number on forth byte and name encoded
        in ASCII on 32 bytes starting from sixteenth

        packet with two first bytes and forth (slot of the preset) the
        same as in name packet

    current state of the amp in the form:

        name of the current preset in the form as described above

        amplifiers setting in the form the same as when setting
        amplifier's settings (below) except that first byte is not
        "0x03" but "0x01" and preset number encoded on the forth byte

        settings of four effects as described below with the same
        change to the first byte as in amplifier's settings and preset
        number encoded on the forth byte

        setting of some mysterious device with address "0x0a"

        confirmation packet same as in preset names 

    names with settings of all presets on the Mod and Dly/Rev knobs
    (first all settings for Mod knob then all settings for Dly/Rev
    knob) in the form:

        name of the preset in the form: values "0x1c 0x01 0x04" as
        first three bytes, value "0x01" for Mod or "0x02" for Dly/Rev
        knob on third position, slot number on forth position (counted
        from zero), name encoded in ASCII on 24 bytes starting from
        sixteenth byte

        settings of the effect in the same form as for setting the
        effect (below) except that first byte is "0x01" not "0x03" and
        preset number encoded on the forth byte

        This packet is set only when sending Dly/Rev presets Dly/Rev
        knob hold settings for two effects so the next packet carries
        info about second effect, if effect is not set the packet have
        the same form as packet for clearing effect except that first
        byte is "0x01" not "0x03" and preset number encoded on the
        forth byte

        confirmation packet with values "0x1c 0x01" on zeroth and
        first byte, "0x01" or "0x02" depending on the knob on third
        byte and preset number encoded on the forth byte

Wireshark file with whole initialization communication can be found here.

3. Setting amp

Format of data for setting amp is as follow:

     0                                       1
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   1   2   3   4   5
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
00 | 1c| 03|DSP|     00    | 01| 01|               00              |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
16 |mod|                         00                                |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
32 |vol|gai|ga2|mvl|tre|mid|bas|prs|?? |dep|bis|?? |   number  |ng |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
48 |ths|cab|?? |sag|bri| 01|?? |               00                  |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

DSP - for amplifier it is always 5
mod - amplifier model; different for each emulated amp
vol - volume
gai - gain
ga2 - gain 2
mvl - master volume
tre - treble
mid - middle
bas - bass
prs - presence
dep - depth
bis - bias
number - don't know what this is; different for each emulated amp
ng - noise gate; value 0x00 - 0x05
ths - threshold; value 0x00 - 0x09
cab - cabinet; value 0x00 - 0x0c
sag - sag; value 0x00 - 0x02
bri - brightness; value 0x00-0x01
?? - values which I haven't decoded yet; different for each emulated amp

After packet with data described above you have to send a packet which
will tell the amp to actually apply the settings. This packet have
zeroth byte set to "0x1c", first to "0x03" and all other to "0x00".

4. Setting and clearing effects

Data format for setting an effect is:

     0                                       1
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   1   2   3   4   5
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
00 | 1c| 03|DSP|     00    | 01| 01|               00              |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
16 |fxm| 00|slt| ??| ??| ??|en |               00                  |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
32 |kb1|kb2|kb3|kb4|kb5|kb6|                   00                  |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
48 |                               00                              |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

DSP - can be either 6, 7, 8 or 9; depends on effect familly
fxm - effect model; independent for each effect
slt - slot; before amp have numbers from 0 to 3, after from 4 to 7
      kb1, kb2, kb3, kb4, kb5, kb6 - knobs values; not every time 
      all are used; maximum value of the knob depends on the effect
?? - some strange numbers specific for each effect
en - Effect state (1 = off, 0 = on)

If you want to remove the effect send normal effect-setting packet but
set "effect model" and knobs fields to zeros.  I haven't tried what
happens if you send such packet to DSP 0x05.

"Execute" command for both setting and clearing the effect is the same
as for the amp setting.

5. Saving settings on amplifier

Saving settings is very easy since you don't have to transmit all the
settings which you want to store. You only send a command containing
slot number and name for a preset. Data are taken directly from DSPs.

Packet format is:

     0                                       1
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   1   2   3   4   5
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
00 | 1c| 01| 03| 00|SLT| 00| 01| 01|               00              |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
16 |                              name                             |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
32 |                              name                             |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
48 |                               00                              |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

SLT - memory bank to which to save settings; value 0x00 - 0x17

name - name of the preset ended with "\0"; if not all fields are used
  used the rest is set to 0x00

Fender FUSE after saving settings chooses memory bank it just
saved. PLUG also does this.

6. Choosing memory bank

"Choose memory bank" command looks like this:

     0                                       1
     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   1   2   3   4   5
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
00 | 1c| 01| 01| 00|SLT| 00| 01|                 00                |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
16 |                               00                              |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
32 |                               00                              |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
48 |                               00                              |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

SLT - memory bank to choose

After choosing memory bank amplifier send you settings of that bank.

7. Captured data

Wireshark file with whole initialization communication can be found
here: http://piorekf.org/plug/files/initialization.log And here are
data from captured packets for setting all the amps and effects (only
hex part, the rest are my scribbles):
